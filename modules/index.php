                            The Catering to Cabo team is incredible! Book them now! They catered our wedding and a
                            family dinner the thursday before and everything all perfect. The food at the family dinner
                            was amazing; our family still raves about it. The level of service at both events was 100%,
                            some of the best we've ever had. They made sure that every need was met from making our
                            parents drinks on Thursday (not on the menu), bringing our guests at the wedding drinks on
                            the dance floor, and my favorite, dressing up glow sticks and individually handing them to
                            out to all guests.
                            <br>
                            Susana from catering to Cabo was our wedding planner/coordinator and was AMAZING! She has
                            great taste and gave us great ideas/advice. I had a couple unique asks and she went above
                            and beyond to make them happen. On the day of the wedding, she made sure our vision was
                            perfectly executed and we could enjoy a beautiful day and party.

                        <p>
                            Catering to Cabo is an exceptional catering company with amazing people! We were fortunate
                            to work with them to design our destination wedding day menu, bartending, and event planning
                            services, however due to the COVID-19 pandemic we needed to change plans to instead have a
                            smaller anniversary party 1 year later. Throughout the entire planning process, Susana and
                            Elmar‚Äôs teams were very flexible and service oriented. We started with over the phone
                            consultation, emailing, and then were able to meet in person for a catering tasting and
                            vendor meeting at our rental condo while visiting San Jose del Cabo. We were sad when the US
                            restrictions solidified our decision to change the location of our wedding, but knew that we
                            absolutely still wanted to have a celebration that included Catering to Cabo and their other
                            amazing vendor contacts. They were understanding and willing to work with us at a later date
                            without any penalty which we really appreciated. We kept in contact with Susana and planned
                            a 1 year anniversary dinner party at our venue the villa Casa Mariposa. Even though our
                            event was scaled back from the original, we were met with warmth, professionalism, and level
                            of service that makes you feel very special and like family. Beyond that, we enjoyed the
                            most delicious food for our anniversary dinner: Filet Mignon and lobster for the main
                            course. It truly was one of, if not the best meal I have ever enjoyed. Our personal chefs,
                            bartender, and server ensured that we and our guests were taken care of the whole night.
                            Without a doubt I highly recommend Catering to Cabo for your personal chef or event needs
                            while in Los Cabos!

                            I can't say enough great things about Catering to Cabo. We used them for our villa wedding
                            in Los Cabos and we are so glad we did. First, Susana was an excellent coordinator. She
                            handled every detail the day of and spent countless hours with us the year before making
                            sure our wedding was everything we wanted. Secondly, the food and service was phenomenal. I
                            had so many wedding guests come up to me during the wedding and after to tell me how amazing
                            they thought the food was and how impressed they were with the service- my guests truly
                            wanted for nothing throughout the wedding. Lastly, Susana and team even coordinated a
                            rehearsal dinner for us at our favorite local taco spot that normally doesn't accommodate
                            large parties. It was so important for us to share our favorite taco joint with our family
                            and friends and Susana made that happen. We can not recommend their services enough!

                            My husband and I can not rave enough about the wonderful service Catering to Cabo provided.
                            We utilized them for our destination wedding, and they took care of our every need!
                            Susana Flores helped me organize and plan the wedding while I was miles away in California.
                            She was so meticulous and caring about my every wish and made my vision come to life. The
                            chef services were so incredible, we booked for our welcome dinner, wedding day, and Sunday
                            brunch! The entire staff really helped elevate our vacation and they were all a huge part in
                            helping us create unforgettable memories. Thank you CTC!

                            I can't begin to tell you how amazing Susana and her team were! She made herself available
                            for all of our questions and always got back to us so quickly.

                            We had never been to the venue my wife and I chose for our wedding prior to our wedding
                            weekend and Susana made all our nerves go away! Planning a wedding is stressful and planning
                            a wedding somewhere you have never seen other than pictures is even harder. Susana made the
                            whole process so easy!

                            Susana and her team were so incredibly nice and were always available to help in any way
                            they could. They are truly went above and beyond! They really made our wedding weekend
                            unforgettable.

                            Not only was the team and service amazing, but the food was out of this world! All the guest
                            kept coming up to me commenting on how friendly everyone was and how awesome the food was.

                            We will definitely be visiting Cabo again in the future and there is no question we will
                            work with Susana and her team again!

                        <p>
                            We had Catering to Cabo cater a meal to our house our first night in Cabo. Everything was
                            set up when we arrived hot and ready to go with Margaritas chilling in the fridge! What a
                            gift after traveling all day and pricing is comparable to going out. Our 3rd day in we had
                            the chefs come to the house and prepare a meal for us. It was the best surf n turf we had on
                            vacation. They brought everything with them, including ice for drinks. They served us drinks
                            and apps on the patio and decorated our dining table with beautiful flowers for the dinner.
                            Everything about this was terrific and again pricing is what you'd pay in a restaurant. When
                            they left the dishes were done, kitchen was better then they found it AND they took the
                            garbage with them! Super easy to work with, allowed us to make our own menus, friendly and
                            so good.
